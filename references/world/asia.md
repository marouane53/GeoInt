# Asia clues: East, Southeast, South and Central Asia

Scope: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, South Asia (India to state level) and Central Asia. Mainland China has its own file (`china.md`, pointer below); Russia is in `europe.md` (Siberia note near the end).
Plate formats and paint colours were checked 2026-10 where a source is named. Old plates and old paint stay on the road for years, so every "changed in year X" fact is also a dating clue.

## Region-wide patterns

### Driving side
- Left: JP, HK, MO, TH, MY, SG, ID, BN, TL, IN, BD, LK, NP, BT, PK, MV. Right: KR, TW, CN, MN, KH, LA, VN, PH, MM, KZ, KG, UZ, TJ, TM, RU. Check with `clues.py lookup driving-side left`.
- Thailand flips side at its borders with Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia (all right-hand; Malaysia keeps left); so do HK and Macau against the mainland.
- Steering wheel and traffic side disagree in Myanmar (right-hand traffic, mostly right-hand-drive Japanese imports) and, less uniformly, in Mongolia and the Russian Far East. A right-hand-drive car keeping right narrows Asia to these.
