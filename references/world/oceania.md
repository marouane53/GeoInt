# Oceania clues: Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands

Scope: Australia (state level), New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and other Pacific islands briefly. Hawaii, Easter Island and the Galápagos are in `americas.md`; Indonesian Papua is in `asia.md`.
Facts were checked 2026-10 where a source is named. Pacific plate and paint details are thinly documented, so many cells say "unverified"; use driving side, language and codes there instead.

## Region-wide patterns

### Driving side
- Left: AU, NZ, PG, FJ, WS (since 7 September 2009), TO, SB, KI, TV, NR, CK, NU, NF. Right: VU, the French territories (NC, PF, WF), the US territories (GU, MP, AS) and the US-associated states (PW, MH, FM).
- Mismatches: Samoa still has many left-hand-drive cars from before the switch; Palau drives on the right with many right-hand-drive imports.
- Check with `clues.py lookup driving-side right`; list dependencies with `clues.py lookup territories France` (or `United States`, `New Zealand`).

### Plates
- Australia: colour scheme and state name or slogan differ by state (strong for state of registration).
- New Zealand: one national design, no regional coding.
- French territories keep the pre-2009 French layout (6 digits + NC or P); US territories use US-size plates with the territory name and a slogan; Fiji black on white.

### Road paint, posts and sign families
- White centre lines: AU (double white = no overtaking) and NZ (with solid yellow no-passing lines); French territories French style (unverified per territory).
- Yellow centre lines: US territories (Guam; American Samoa and CNMI unverified).
- Edge posts: AU white posts with red reflectors on the left of the road and white on the right; NZ white reflectors on the left and yellow on the right.
- Sign families: AU and NZ yellow diamonds, GIVE WAY, km/h; US territories yellow diamonds, YIELD, mph, MUTCD shields; French territories red-bordered triangles and "Cédez le passage".

### Vegetation and landform (weak without a month)
- Australia: eucalypts nearly everywhere; red soil, spinifex and mulga inland; palms, pandanus and termite mounds in the tropical north; temperate rainforest and button grass in Tasmania.
- New Zealand: very green pasture with sheep and cattle, Pinus radiata plantations, native bush with tree ferns, cabbage trees and flax, snowy Southern Alps.
- High (volcanic) Pacific islands: steep green peaks, rainforest, a coastal ring road. Low islands (atolls): flat strips with only coconut and pandanus, causeways between islets.

### Pacific orthographies (text decides fast; check with `textgeo.py --text "<string>"`)

| Language | Letters and look | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Māori | wh, ng, macrons ā ē ī ō ū; no s, l, f | New Zealand |
| Samoan | g = ng sound, s, l, f, ʻ, macrons; k and h mostly in loanwords | Samoa, American Samoa |
| Tongan | h, k, ng, ʻ | Tonga |
| Tahitian | ʻ and many vowels; no k, g, l, s | French Polynesia |
| Hawaiian | only a e i o u h k l m n p w ʻ, macrons | Hawaii (`americas.md`) |

### State plate colours and names
- Look for: character and background colour, state name or slogan line, serial pattern
- Points to: state or territory of registration (quick facts above)
- Strength: strong for registration (each state issues its own design); medium for location (interstate travel, caravans on long highways)
- Counterexamples: optional designs (white NSW premium plates, custom colours, personalised plates); older slogans still on the road; fleet and rental cars registered in another state
- Verify: `refsheet.py regions AU:New South Wales,AU:Victoria,AU:Queensland`; several local cars agree
- Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Australia checked 2026-10

- Counterexamples: occasional examples outside SA (unverified); SA also has wooden and concrete poles, so their absence does not exclude SA
- Verify: `refsheet.py regions AU:South Australia,AU:Victoria`
- Source: general knowledge

### Alphanumeric route markers vs numbered shields
- Look for: markers such as M1, A32, B23, C512, or shields (green-gold National Highway, white National Route, blue State Route)
- Points to: alphanumeric = every state except WA (TAS since 1979, VIC and SA in the 1990s, NSW and ACT in 2013, QLD and NT partly); shields only = Western Australia; blue metropolitan shields survive in Melbourne
- Strength: medium
- Counterexamples: old signs survive after conversion; Queensland mixes both; NT converts as signs are replaced
- Verify: `osm.py near` for the road ref at the candidate point
- Source: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_in_Australia checked 2026-10

- Source: general knowledge

### Red No Stopping signs
- Look for: a "NO STOPPING" kerbside sign with white lettering on a red panel with a thin white border
- Points to: New South Wales (sign R5-400); other states use the white R5-35 sign (red ring and slash over a black S)
- Strength: strong (a statewide sign type)
- Counterexamples: the ACT has white No Stopping signs with text (community source); NSW No Parking signs are white, so read the wording; whether older white NSW versions survive: unverified
- Verify: `refsheet.py regions "AU:New South Wales,AU:Victoria" --n 6 --side left`

### Black pole-number strips
- Look for: a timber pole with a black-painted strip about 2.7 m up carrying a vertical or diagonal column of silver numerals, sometimes with a B or W prefix
- Points to: South East Queensland (Brisbane; the community source adds the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast), not the whole state
- Strength: medium (an official specification exists for Brisbane City Council poles; the wider area rests on a community source)
- Counterexamples: Ergon poles elsewhere in Queensland carry a number about 2.4 m up, appearance unverified; NZ poles carry black number stickers (community source)
- Verify: `refsheet.py towns "-27.47,153.03:Brisbane;-28.00,153.43:Gold Coast;-19.26,146.82:Townsville" --side left --pitch 5`

## Commonly confused

### Australia / New Zealand
- Plates: Australian plates show a state colour scheme and name or slogan; New Zealand plates are plain black on white ABC123.
- Centre lines: NZ solid yellow no-passing lines; AU double white lines.
- Edge posts: AU red reflectors on the left; NZ white on the left, yellow on the right.
- Route signs: NZ red SH shields; AU alphanumeric markers (or WA and QLD shields).
- Vegetation: eucalypts dominate even in wet Australian areas; NZ has pine plantations, tree ferns, cabbage trees, flax and very green pasture.
- Codes: +61 (02/03/07/08) vs +64 (03/04/06/07/09). Both use 4-digit postcodes, so a postcode alone does not decide.
- Place names: Māori (wh, ng, macrons) vs Aboriginal-derived names (Wagga Wagga, Woolloomooloo, -up endings in WA).

### Australian states
- Plates first; then phone group (02 NSW/ACT, 03 VIC/TAS, 07 QLD, 08 SA/WA/NT) and the postcode first digit.
- Routes: WA has no alphanumeric routes; Victoria has many C routes; Adelaide has R routes.
- Infrastructure: Stobie poles = SA; trams with hook turns = Melbourne; Queenslander houses = QLD.
- Landscape: Tasmania cool and hilly; NT and WA interior red; Top End tropical; Perth sandy.

### New Zealand / UK and Ireland look-alikes
- All drive on the left with green pastures and hedges.
- UK: red-bordered warning triangles, mph, yellow rear plates, no yellow centre lines.
- Ireland: yellow diamond warnings and km/h like NZ, but plates carry a county code and an EU band, signs are bilingual Irish-English, and yellow lines mark the road edge rather than no-passing zones.
