# Search: reverse image search, keyword image search, social media search

SKILL.md Step 3, in parallel with lookup-table clues. All engines below are pre-approved: run them without asking. In 5 of the 20 puzzles in the videos this step was the breakthrough, yet it costs the least.

## 1. Reverse image search

```bash
# Make variants first: tight crop of a distinctive object / horizontal flip / grayscale enhancement / color-cast removal; rectify rephotographed material first
uv run scripts/imgprep.py variants photo.jpg --box 300,120,900,760 --out-dir v/
uv run scripts/imgprep.py variants photo.jpg --persp 312,140,880,95,905,770,290,720 --box ... --out-dir v/
# Baidu image search + Yandex; each image gets a result screenshot and JSON
uv run scripts/revimg.py photo.jpg v/*.jpg --out-dir rev/
```

**Always open the result screenshots and look**: extracted text is only an aid; the scenes in similar images and the titles of source posts matter more. Baidu's similar images are also saved as a numbered contact sheet `<name>_baidu_similar.jpg` (the top-left cell is the query image; number i corresponds to the source page of JSON `similar[i]`). Look at it first: for near-duplicate photos of the same object or scene, the source page (Dianping, Douyin, Xiaohongshu) often gives the shop name or location tag directly.

**How to use place-name labels**: Baidu image search's "图中可能是…" ("the image may show…"), Yandex labels and the Lens AI overview are all candidates; count votes separately by level:
- City level: count which city each crop and each engine named. The same city named by two different crops is more credible than "two contradictory specific places"; specific places that don't agree don't cancel the city they jointly point to.
- Place level: when a label is the name of a residential compound, housing development, hotel or organization, get its coordinates with `poi.py` and check; this often gets you to the area in one step:

```bash
uv run scripts/poi.py "<compound name>" --city <city> --out pois.json      # list every same-name point in the city (360 Maps + OSM, WGS84)
uv run scripts/poi.py "<compound name>"                                    # no city: which cities nationwide have a same-name point
uv run scripts/tiles.py sheet --points pois.json --zoom 18 --out pois_sheet.jpg
```

- When a label is the specific name of a common facility such as a school or residential compound, first open the "图片来源" ("image source") thumbnails to see whether it's the same place (one call): names on images of playgrounds or housing are mostly assembled by voting over similar images; if it isn't the same place, downgrade it to weak and don't bother getting coordinates.
- **Facility-type words** in generic labels ("grain drying complex", "cement plant", "greenhouse") are useful: use them to look up where that industry is concentrated, for category inference and candidate areas.
- When the label is generic ("blocks of housing", "city street", "school playground"), treat it only as weak evidence; if the whole image + one tight crop, one round in each of two engines, give only generic labels, stop; don't keep trying variants.

| Situation | What to do | Source |
|---|---|---|
| The whole image finds nothing | Box only the most distinctive object (statue, building, ornament); remove the sky and background buildings | v010-5, v010-6 |
| Stock photos may have been taken from the other side | Flip horizontally and search again | v010-5 (hit only after flipping) |
| Rephotographed material, oblique shots | Perspective-rectify, remove glare | v004 |
| Old photos with a yellow or purple cast | Remove the color cast or convert to grayscale | v010-6 |
| One engine has no results | Switch engines: Baidu is best for Chinese web pages, Weibo, Baijiahao and scenic-area content; Yandex fills in building and street scenes and foreign content | v009 (Yandex found nothing, Baidu hit) |
| The search UI language biases results | Google Lens with a Chinese UI favors similar buildings on Chinese sites; for foreign scenes switch to English or the local language | v004 |

**Google Lens**: from a script it hits a CAPTCHA, so no script does it. Use a browser-control tool that drives
the owner's own Chrome (for example Claude in
Chrome): open `https://lens.google.com/` (or Google Images → camera icon), upload the original or a tight
crop with the tool's file-upload action, wait for results, then save the page text and a full-page screenshot
into `rev/lens_<crop>.txt|png` in the session folder. If Google shows a CAPTCHA or a sign-in wall, skip Lens for
this photo and note it in the report. For an image that is already public online,
`https://lens.google.com/uploadbyurl?url=<urlencoded image URL>` searches without uploading anything. In tests
Lens is often stronger than Baidu and Yandex, but keep its two result blocks apart:
- "Exact matches / pages that include this image": provenance evidence; usable.
- "AI Overview": forces a place name out of similar-looking photos; a different crop of the same image can yield two places a dozen or so km apart. Treat it only as a candidate; it must be verified back at SKILL.md Steps 6–7.

**Bing Visual Search** and **TinEye** (through the same browser tool): Bing sometimes finds social-media copies
the others miss; TinEye is the tool for finding the oldest, largest or uncropped copy of a photo, which often
carries the original caption, date and place.

Without a browser tool, Lens is unavailable: note in the report that it was not tried, and lean harder on crops, keyword image search and the scripted engines.

### Read the whole list before the top hit

Engines rank visual matches by how alike they look, not by whether they show the same place. Lookalikes (the
same standard design, the same paint scheme, the same chain's fit-out, the same builder's catalogue) crowd the top;
the actual place often sits further down, and a lookalike can absorb an hour of checking.

1. Save the full list from every engine and crop (page text and a screenshot in `rev/`), then write every place
   it names into a candidate table: venue, business, street, town, and the company that built, supplied or
   designed the object when a result names one.
2. Open first, ahead of rank:
   - a place named by **two independent results**: its own page and a builder's, supplier's or architect's
     project page; two unrelated posters; two engines or two different crops;
   - a place whose **name matches text in the photo**: a word, initials, a logo, even a single letter on a badge,
     banner or sign. A fragment on a wall or a uniform is often the place's own brand.
3. Check each named place against two or three fixed features (structure, layout, roof line, skyline, terrain)
   and drop it with a written reason before going deep on any one.
4. Stalled for about 15 minutes on one lead? Return to the saved lists and the table before searching wider.

### Chinese keyword search

General web search tools are often ineffective for Chinese content inside China. Use the script:

```bash
uv run scripts/revimg.py --query "蓝色拱形顶棚 人行天桥 高架" --query "<city> 出租车 颜色" --out-dir q/
```

(Queries in Chinese: "blue arched canopy, pedestrian bridge, elevated road"; "<city> taxi color".)

Bing China gives web results (title + link); Baidu Images and Sogou Images give result-page screenshots (look at photos of similar scenes). For long descriptive queries ("楼顶操场 学校" rooftop playground school, "黄色公交" yellow bus) Bing mostly returns travel-guide pages; look directly at the Baidu Images screenshot. Baidu web search pops up a verification challenge, so it isn't done.

### After a hit

- **Look at the rest of the set**: the hit post is often a set of images, and the others may show plates, road signs or shop names (v009: the plate was in the 5th image of the set). First use shared fixed objects (streetlights, walls, chimneys) to confirm that the photos in the set and the puzzle image are the same place.
- **The candidate's background doesn't match**: it may be a replica, an identical installation, or another branch of the same chain. Once you have the proper name, search another round for "<proper name> 复制品 / replica / 同款" (复制品 = replica, 同款 = same model); the official introduction where the original stands often says where the replicas are (v004).
- **The hit is only a "similar scene"**: use it as a clue (city, scenic-area name), not as a conclusion; go back to SKILL.md Steps 6–7 to verify.
- **For news images, first judge whether it's a real photo**: many news sites illustrate articles with stock images, illustrations or even generated images; before comparing facades, check whether it is this place.

## 2. Choose where to search by object type

| Object | Where to search | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Scenic-area buildings, viral check-in spots | Douyin, Xiaohongshu, Weibo keyword and image search; official scenic-area accounts post videos from the same angle | v010-2, v009 |
| Statues, small park features, foreign attractions | User photos on travel review sites (Tripadvisor, Ctrip reviews); Google Lens | v010-6 |
| New residential developments, commercial complexes | Housing-development albums on property sites (Anjuke, Fang.com, Loupan.com, etc.): the "周边配套" (nearby amenities) and "实景图" (real photos) sections; page all the way to the signboard | v010-5 |
| Old buildings, historic sites | Local culture-and-tourism and protected-heritage-site pages; stock image sites (Visual China Group, Getty, Alamy), whose captions carry place names and years | v004 |
| Ordinary streets and residential areas | Image search adds little; prioritize geometry and infrastructure; when even the city isn't fixed, sample one page of arterial-road street view per candidate city and compare municipal fixtures (`baidu_pano.py sample`) | — |
| Sub-brand stores of chain brands (truck service, refurbishment, specialty stores) | **Search opening press releases first** ("开业 / inaugura / abre / opens + sub-brand + state or city"; 开业 = opens), trade media often give the street address; treat the official store locator only as a candidate pool: it doesn't tag sub-brands, and its coordinates may be off by several km | blind test |
| Built or installed objects (bridges, towers, stadium roofs, sports and play structures, sculptures, shop fit-outs) | The builder's, manufacturer's or architect's project/reference list (often a PDF naming every installation and its town) and the operator's catalogue of its assets (a motorway company's bridges, a chain's branches, a park service's facilities); a results page from such a list also counts as an independent result for the place it names | field tests |
| Nameless facilities found on satellite imagery (plants, warehouses, farms, mines) | Search the web and news for the facility-type word in the local language + nearby place names, and compare the accompanying photos with the facade; once you find the name, search images another round | v013 |
| Vehicle livery (bus, taxi, school bus) | `revimg.py --query "<city> <color description> 公交"` (query in Chinese: <city> <color description> bus), and read route signs and company names from the result images; first resolve any place name you read to a district (county) with `poi.py` before using it; don't treat a vehicle from district A as a clue for district B | v014 |

## 3. Descriptive keyword image search

Suits objects that "you can't name, but have a rare shape" (the v004 fountain).

1. Write the object as a "shape + components + position" phrase: `顶上有金色球形装饰的白色钟楼` (white clock tower with a golden ball ornament on top), `蓝色拱形顶棚的人行天桥` (pedestrian bridge with a blue arched canopy).
2. Prepare both a version **with place names** and one **without**, one set each in Chinese and in English (or the local language), and search them together. Finding nothing with place names is normal: replicas and obscure places have few photos online, while there is more material on the original and on similar objects.
3. If you can't count the shapes, use broad words; don't write a wrong count.
4. Use style words (Romanesque, Gothic, Hui-style) only after checking the form: if the arches are pointed, it isn't Romanesque.

## 4. Social media and check-in spot search

- Viral scenery (cherry-blossom streets, ginkgo avenues, influencer walls, check-in cafés): search `<city> + <scenery>` on Douyin, Xiaohongshu and Weibo, **in both Chinese and English** (English posts about popular foreign streets often include the street name).
- Other posts from the same place give more angles (houses, steps, chimneys) and even location tags.
- Locals' photos of the same mountains or the same river: look in the candidate township's "同城" (local) feed or its place page (the v010-1 creator spoofed the device location to the candidate township to browse local content).
- A city usually has only a dozen or so popular check-in streets; find the list first, then check them one by one.

## 5. Open data (use when clearly effective)

- **City street-tree data** (species, trunk diameter, height class, address number, coordinates): many cities abroad have open datasets (e.g., Vancouver's `public-trees` on `opendata.vancouver.ca`, about 180,000 trees citywide, `exports/csv` takes about 20 s in one request). Suited to puzzles with "a row of some kind of tree + residential street, no text": it narrows the whole city to a few dozen street segments, with the ground truth among them (proposed in the v009 breakdown, used in one real case). Method:
  1. **Pull all species**, not just the target species: later you need to judge "are there trees across the street", and pulling only Prunus would make an opposite side planted with other trees look empty.
  2. **Use cultivar and trunk diameter only to sort, never to filter**: the cultivar in the municipal inventory may not match the actual tree (pale pink Somei-Yoshino-type blossoms in the photo; the inventory lists a white-flowered cultivar), and the trunk diameter may have been measured years ago. Cultivars of the same genus with similar flower color all go in as candidates; exclusion can only rely on invariant features in street view.
  3. **Use odd/even address numbers to fix which side of the street the trees are on**: comparing the coordinates of odd- and even-numbered trees on the same street tells you (in Vancouver, odd numbers are on the north side of east–west Avenues and the west side of north–south Streets; east–west Streets follow the Avenue rule). Then filter with "which side you're standing on, which way you're facing" from the shadows.
  4. **Compute the across-the-street constraint from the field of view**: a portrait phone's horizontal FOV is about 50°, so the grass strip across the street (10–20 m sideways) enters the frame only beyond about 25 m ahead; "no trees across the street" constrains only about 25–50 m ahead, not close by.
  5. Add the filtered street segments to the board in one go with `board.py add --from <street-segment JSON> --level road`; when you drop one, write `evidence --against` with a comparison image (SKILL.md rule 6).
  6. For street view, first pick historical captures from the same season as the photo (`gsv.py near` to see the history, `sheet --date <year>`) and compare facades, retaining walls and lamp-post positions; in summer captures tree crowns and bloom differ a lot, so don't skip a segment because "the trees look small".
- Local government and media reports: after locating, look up the name, size and year built of unusual man-made objects in the frame (scenic spots, towers, statues) (v008).

## Common mistakes

- Using only one engine and searching only the whole image; after a failure, not changing the image or the engine.
- Opening the first visual match and spending the session on it, while a lower result named the same place twice or matched a letter or logo in the photo.
- Turning the "object category" from an AI or image recognition directly into a location ("boat-shaped sculpture → tourist city"); this jump counts only as weak evidence (v005).
- Getting carried off by the "most famous similar place" the search turns up and forgetting to come back and check bearings and details (the main way the AI failed in v010).
- Two engines each point at a different city, and you draw a big circle around the midpoint of the two and call it done: instead run a discriminating test and pick one as the main answer (SKILL.md rule 7).
- Image search gave a residential compound or housing-development name, and you didn't get its coordinates.
